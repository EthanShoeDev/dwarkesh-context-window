  "title": "Adam Marblestone – AI is missing something fundamental about the brain",
  "description": "Adam Marblestone is CEO of Convergent Research. He’s had a very interesting past life; Research Scientist at Google Deepmind on their neuroscient team; has worked on brain computer interfaces to quantum computing and nanotech to formal mathematics.\n\nWhere we discuss how the brain learns so much from so little, what the AI field can learn from neuroscience, and the answer to Ilya’s question: how does the genome encode abstract reward functions? Turns out, they’re all the same question.\n\n𝐄𝐏𝐈𝐒𝐎𝐃𝐄 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒\n* Transcript: https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/adam-marblestone\n* Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/adam-marblestone-ai-is-missing-something-fundamental/id1516093381?i=1000743205259\n* Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/5RD8lxJh0mGSlpEWWExQNG?si=srfZ9QBgRFqvOtJGX8EGqg\n\n𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐎𝐑𝐒\n- Gemini 3 Pro recently helped me run an experiment to test multi-agent scaling: basically, if you have a fixed budget of compute, what is the optimal way to split it up across agents? Gemini was my colleague throughout the process — honestly, I couldn’t have investigated this question without it.

Labelbox’s network of subject-matter experts ensures you get hyper-realistic RL environments, and their custom tooling lets you generate the highest-quality training data possible from those environments.
