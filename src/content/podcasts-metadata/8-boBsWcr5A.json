  "title": "Satya Nadella – How Microsoft thinks about AGI",
  "description": "As part of this interview, Satya Nadella gave me and Dylan Patel (founder of SemiAnalysis) an exclusive first-look at their brand-new Fairwater 2 datacenter.\n\nMicrosoft is building multiple Fairwaters, each of which has hundreds of thousands of GB200s & GB300s. Between all these interconnected buildings, they’ll have over 2 GW of total capacity. Just to give a frame of reference, even a single one of these Fairwater buildings is more powerful than any other AI datacenter that currently exists.\n\nSatya then answered a bunch of questions about how Microsoft is preparing for AGI across all layers of the stack.\n\n𝐄𝐏𝐈𝐒𝐎𝐃𝐄 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒\n* Transcript: https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/satya-nadella-2\n* Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/satya-nadella-how-microsoft-is-preparing-for-agi/id1516093381?i=1000736461892\n* Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/290a568fldDQBrPhYOCZFK?si=71a120f868384ffd\n\n𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐎𝐑𝐒\n* Labelbox produces high-quality data at massive scale, powering any capability you want your model to have.
