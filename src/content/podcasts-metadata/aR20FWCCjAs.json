  "description": "Ilya & I discuss SSI’s strategy, the problems with pre-training, how to improve the generalization of AI models, and how to ensure AGI goes well.\n\n𝐄𝐏𝐈𝐒𝐎𝐃𝐄 𝐋𝐈𝐍𝐊𝐒\n* Transcript: https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/ilya-sutskever-2\n* Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dwarkesh-podcast/id1516093381?i=1000738363711\n* Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/episode/7naOOba8SwiUNobGz8mQEL?si=39dd68f346ea4d49\n\n𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐍𝐒𝐎𝐑𝐒\n- Gemini 3 is the first model I’ve used that can find connections I haven’t anticipated. I recently wrote a blog post on RL’s information efficiency, and Gemini 3 helped me think it all through. It also generated the relevant charts and ran toy ML experiments for me with zero bugs. Try Gemini 3 today at https://gemini.google\n- Labelbox helped me create a tool to transcribe our episodes! I’ve struggled with transcription in the past because I don’t just want verbatim transcripts, I want transcripts reworded to read like essays. Labelbox helped me generate the *exact* data I needed for this. If you want to learn how Labelbox can help you (or if you want to try out the transcriber tool yourself), go to https://labelbox.com/dwarkesh\n- Sardine is an AI risk management platform that brings together thousands of device, behavior, and identity signals to help you assess a user’s risk of fraud & abuse. Sardine also offers a suite of agents to automate investigations so that as fraudsters use AI to scale their attacks, you can use AI to scale your defenses.
